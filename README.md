# Project 6 - *Insta*

**Insta** is a photo sharing app using Parse as its backend.

Time spent: **30+** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign up to create a new account using Parse authentication
- [x] User can log in and log out of his or her account
- [x] The current signed in user is persisted across app restarts
- [x] User can take a photo, add a caption, and post it to "Instagram"
- [x] User can view the last 20 posts submitted to "Instagram"

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Show the username and creation time for each post
- [x] After the user submits a new post, show a progress HUD while the post is being uploaded to Parse.
- [x] User Profiles:
   - [x] Allow the logged in user to add a profile photo
   - [x] Display the profile photo with each post
   - [x] Tapping on a post's username or profile photo goes to that user's profile page

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Ability to like a post 
- [x] collection view of user's own photos on profile page
- [x] tab for profile view
- [x] keeps track of number of posts
- [x] can take pictures and post (don't know if that counts)
- [x] navigation bar at the top is clear
- [x] username displayed at top of profile view
- [x] keeps track of how many posts the user has on profile
- [x] timestamp keeps track of time elapsed rather than creation time (sorry i had to modify the optional so idk if this counts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. infinite scrolling
2. how to add constraints programmatically (spent about half the time trying to do that)

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

I spent almost half the time trying to figure out constraints programmatically to add to the old comments optional user story and could not figure it out that's why i took so long
